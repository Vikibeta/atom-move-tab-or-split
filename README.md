# Move tab or split

Move your tabs around, and split to a new pane if there'r no panes in that direction.

When you move from a single tab pane, that pane will be removed.

Can move up, down, left, right.

Can't split if the tab is the only tab in a pane.

## Shortcuts:

`alt + ctrl + left`

`alt + ctrl + right`

`alt + ctrl + up`

`alt + ctrl + down`
